# Simple code challenge #

I made a class 'csv_result' that have the variables used to compare the data of the csv file as attributes, so it can be use everytime we want to compared an csv with that format. Also, i changed the hardcoded columns numbers for variables so if the order or the count of the columns changes in the future, it will be easy to modify.

Please, tell me if i made mistakes or there was other improvements that can be made.

Thank you for the ruby code challenge.
